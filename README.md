# My-Project
A responsive e-commerce platform designed to enhance user experience.

Designed and developed a responsive e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3 for showcasing artwork.

Created four key pages: Home, About Us, Artwork, and Contact Us, incorporating intuitive navigation and user-friendly layouts.

Ensured responsiveness across devices by leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and components.

Styled artwork sections using custom CSS animations and effects to enhance visual appeal.

Integrated a carousel for dynamic image display and hover effects for interactivity on artwork cards.

Developed interactive forms for user inputs (name, email, message) and optimized frontend performance for smooth user interactions.
